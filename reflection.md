I struggled with the refurbish method in my code. I didn't know if I should put it in the retail shop or the computer file because I needed information from both to execute my code. In the computer file, I couldn't check if the computer I was trying to refurbish was in my inventory or not because inventory was an attribute in the resale shop. Alternatively, I couldn't retrieve the needed operating system attribute if I put refurbish in the resale shop file.
