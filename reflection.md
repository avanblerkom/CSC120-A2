What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I struggled with the refurbish method in my code. I didn't know if I should put it in the retail shop or the computer file because I needed information from both to execute my code. In the computer file, I couldn't check if the computer I was trying to refurbish was in my inventory or not because inventory was an attribute in the resale shop. Alternatively, I couldn't retrieve the needed operating system attribute if I put refurbish in the resale shop file. 

I ended up realizing that as long as I addressed the computer.py file when updating price, everything worked - this "big issue" was me overthinking a small mistake that I missed the first time through.
